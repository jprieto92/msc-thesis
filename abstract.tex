In the recent years, the large volumes of stream data and the near real-time requirements of data streaming applications have exacerbated the need for new scalable algorithms and programming interfaces for distributed and shared-memory platforms. To contribute in this direction, this work presents a new distributed \acrshort{mpi} back end for \acrshort{grppi}, a C ++ high-level generic interface of data-intensive and stream processing parallel patterns. This back end, as a new execution policy, supports the distributed and hybrid (distributed and shared-memory) parallel execution of the pipeline and farm patterns, where the hybrid mode combines the \acrshort{mpi} policy with a \acrshort{grppi} shared-memory one. %, i.e., OpenMP, C++ Threads or Intel TBB. 
%To tackle heterogeneous platforms, we have added the operator \texttt{run\_with} that acts as a wrapper for streaming patterns and is able to replace the default execution policy by a more suitable one for a specific \pipeline stage. 
A detailed analysis of the \acrshort{grppi} \acrshort{mpi} execution policy reports considerable benefits from the programmability, flexibility and readability points of view. The experimental evaluation on a streaming application with different distributed and shared-memory scenarios reports considerable performance gains with respect to the sequential versions at the expense of negligible \acrshort{grppi} overheads.
